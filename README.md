Conway’s Game of Life, a cellular automata simulation. My educational project from Al Sweigart book “The Big Book of Small Python Projects”
Conway’s Game of Life is a cellular automata simulation that follows simple rules to create interesting patterns. It’s more an interesting visualization than a true “game.” The two
dimensional board has a grid of “cells,” each of which follows three simple rules:
 • Living cells with two or three neighbors stay alive in the next step of the 
simulation.
 • Dead cells with exactly three neighbors become alive in the next step of 
the simulation.
 • Any other cell dies or stays dead in the next step of the simulation
