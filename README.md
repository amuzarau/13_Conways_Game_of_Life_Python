Conway’s Game of Life, a cellular automata simulation. My educational project from Al Sweigart book “The Big Book of Small Python Projects”

Conway’s Game of Life is a cellular automata simulation that follows simple rules to create interesting patterns. It’s more an interesting visualization than a true “game.” The two
dimensional board has a grid of “cells,” each of which follows three simple rules:
• Living cells with two or three neighbors stay alive in the next step of the simulation.
• Dead cells with exactly three neighbors become alive in the next step of the simulation.
• Any other cell dies or stays dead in the next step of the simulation

The living or dead state of the cells in the next step of the simulation depends entirely on their current state. The cells don’t “remember” any older states. There is a large body of research regarding the patterns that these simple rules produce.
